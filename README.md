# 🧩 Compatibility Check

This mini-app was developed as part of the "My First Swift Apps (Updated)" course  [swiftbook.org](https://swiftbook.org).The course demonstrates creating an app using Storyboard, however I decided to take a different route and implement the project entirely through code, without using Storyboard.

This allowed for a deeper understanding of the programmatic approach to creating interfaces in iOS.

## 🔑 Key Features
* 🖼️ **Fully programmatic interface**: All UI elements are created without using Storyboard.
* 🎓 **Educational purpose**: The app serves as a tool to learn the basics of Swift and iOS development.
* 🔧 **SnapKit integration**: Uses a popular library to simplify Auto Layout in code.

## 🛠️ Technology
* 🐦 **Swift**: The main programming language.
* 💻 **Xcode**: Integrated development environment for testing and writing code.
* 📏 **SnapKit**: Library for simplifying Auto Layout description in code.

## 🎯 Project goals
* 🌍 Demonstration of iOS-application development capabilities without using Storyboard.
* 🧩 To consolidate knowledge on UI creation and controlling application logic through code.
* 📚 Providing an example for novice developers learning Swift and iOS.

## 📦 Functionality
* 🧩 Checks the compatibility of names. 
* 🪄 Simple and easy to understand interface.
* 🚀 A basis for experimentation and extensions.
