# Compatibility Check

This mini-app was developed as part of the "My First Swift Apps (Updated)" course on [swiftbook.org](https://swiftbook.org). While the course demonstrated how to create an app using storyboard, I chose to build this app entirely with code, avoiding the use of storyboard for a more programmatic approach.

## Features

- **No Storyboard**: The app is built entirely with Swift code, showcasing a programmatic approach to iOS development.
- **Compatibility Checking**: The app provides functionality to check compatibility between different inputs.
- **Educational Purpose**: It serves as a learning tool for understanding the fundamentals of Swift and iOS development.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: The primary programming language used for iOS development.
- **Xcode**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for building and testing the app.
- **SnapKit**: A popular third-party library used for Auto Layout in Swift, making it easier to define constraints programmatically.

## Goals

- To demonstrate the ability to build an iOS app without relying on storyboard.
- To provide a clear example of how to manage UI and logic purely through code.
- To offer a resource for beginners learning Swift and iOS development.
